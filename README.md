# Cameron Ball 👋

Hi, I'm Cameron.

Obsessed with all things computers, especially...

- 🎨 UI/UX Design
- ⚙️ DX, DevOps, CI/CD
- 🔭 Theoretical Computer Science
- 🗺️ Software Design
- ♿️ Computer Accessibility
- 🌎 NLP, Internationalisation, and Localisation
- 📝 Documentation and Note Taking (I'm an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) fan for life)
- 👨‍💻 Python, Rust, Go, Shell, TypeScript, and any functional langauge...

Currently I do front-end and API work for [@americanexpress](https://github.com/americanexpress), and I couldn't be happier with where I'm at. I don't have a ton of time for personal projects, but from time to time I put a laughably bad project up here. Enjoy :)
